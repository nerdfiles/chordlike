# chordlike's plan

chordlike is about WebChords. a WebChord is a concept i theorized when working
on a different project, or perhaps even back when i started my first re-design
of my first (self-hosted) webjournal (a weedy florilegium). fundamentally, the 
concept fits into an ontology as a "norm" (so that we can start talking about 
its existence among others). without digging into the ontological specificity 
here, a "chord" is something like a `<input />` with super powers, but in
truth, the locus of capability begins from the cursor and its "shadow" as it
were: `_[_]`

it goes without saying that the cursor is a ubiquitous feature of interfaces;
it's everywhere. it's recognizable albeit not "simple" for its ubiquity
belies any functionality unique to it which isn't dependent on context:
cursors reveal keys pressed, cursors present tooltips, etc. these are
all cursor-centric capabilities which emerge in the use activity of programs.
a "chord" is really nothing more than the idea of a generic cursor
as a client, or, staple capabilities which trascend interfaces (word vs a
"browser"). cursors appear in address bars, in search fields, on overlaying
"notes" windows, etc. a "chord" might manifest as some string sequence
one types across all interfaces. sometimes in a search engine we type
advanced queries, other times in a calculator, we "enter" simple math.
the latter can be thought of as a query, the former can be thought of as
an algebraic expression. *chords* i think are my first attempt at thinking
through generic strings as real substance of universe.

## quality properties of web

some questions hearkening to morton, by way of [kittler], or mcluhan, or someone 
like them:

1. *is software better than the quality of software?*
2. *does software mean being constantly present?*
3. *can software see nothing?*

1. scaleability☁
2. evolvability☁
3. discoverability☁
4. specializability (??)
5. concretizability: "[...] it is unrealistic to assume that a system has full 
   access to the global state, e.g., that a process can observe the private 
   variables of the other processes." (Abstraction Refinement for Games with 
   Incomplete Information. Rayna Dimitrova†, Bernd Finkbeiner)
6. traceability (??)
7. adjustability (??)
8. incrementability (??)
9. accessibility
   1. perceivability
   2. (in)operosity
   3. comprehensibility/understandability
	 4. robustness
10. sustainability (??)
