      // what the structure is here but what is important is that we're sending
      // a "message", we're "message-passing"[ovm]. fundamentally, the client
      // would be committed to a rational not unlike what we find in the "bitcoin"
      // concept, except that it's "harder," as it were: every request is
      // committed to "running the same code" (between client and server, or in a 
      // peerless scenario). you and i know what "+" is. you and i know what "=" means.
      // but our knowledge does not guarantee faithful transmission, where here
      // we must employ rules to a specificity relevant to a logic ready-at-hand.
      // in truth, the client could send much more than "+" and some numbers.
      // the hypermedia-orientation invites us to orient a non-metacomputational
      // surface by which the client and server (or peers) establish medium
      // specificity. some might think that "epistemology as epistemic justification"
      // is just a round about way of getting back at zero-knowledge proofs.
      // what we are seeking here is a way for joint epistemic sponteneity
      // to inform a relevance logic based on deep semantic hashing. from the 
      // client's perspective, it sends a language and the participating server
      // may come up with its own sense for what "+" means but it is not based
      // on any "mental" history (nor cookies nor anything else) of the client,
      // but based on an insufficiency of the computational to review past
      // data of prior metacomputational actuality to clone presentations for
      // the purposes of entropic memory, where real representations and imaginary ones
      // cohere to coterminous dimensional spaces. a general idea here is that
      // the payload may be dressed as-if any other node might parse its request,
      // but it is important that the language given for the request is treated
      // as evolving. the "+" and the "=" in this case would not mere be enshrouded
      // in encryption nor embezzled through some steganography technique. rather,
      // the payload would itself be "living." its very terms would come with
      // meaning about them: what may look like static data, would in truth be
      // a knot homotopy whose link depends on an appropriate metacomputational
      // affinity between peerless agencies capable of performing cuts to
      // enable recognition of the meaning of definition immanent to the living
      // payload. a server could very well consider "3+3" to be a well-formed
      // bit of data to operate on. it might think "=" is no sweat. however,
      // the payload may be ciphered to transformations of evolutionary 
      // periodization such that relation operators co-determine the ingress
      // through which non-metacomputational selection aggregates to learnable
      // compute (i.e., cloning; or, non-autorepresentational computational 
      // immediacy; hyperparallelism from formal formlessness, etc.).
